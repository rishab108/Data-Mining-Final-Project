during ufc night  scooters be a cool bar especially if youre a seahawks fan i recall a few year ago before the seahawks be even good this bar would get pack on sundays i can only imagine how busy it will get now that they be the defend champ i use to go and watch the ufc fight here all the time stand room only and you get to get there early the bar as well as din room get jam pack there be several old school video game here most notably a street fighter ii champion edition game this machine alone be enough for my friends and i to drop by they also have dart board a pool table and a shuffle board table as far as the bar go its your typical setup not much different from a pts or putter where i feel scooters excel at be their food i can recall the first time i go in my friend and i be in the neighborhood look for a quick bite at that time scooters be new i dont recall what we order but i remember the both of us think wow this food be good and i have never be disappoint since the appetizer sampler platter be huge and only 16 you get wing finger potato skin and mozzarella stick the nachos be also enormous best part be at the end youre not leave with a pile of chip they put a ton of toppings on these bad boys if you get their wing i highly recommend the spicy garlic another favorite of mine be the pastrami burger fry egg i believe it be a 1 2lb patty with a heap help of pastrami lettuce tomato onion and mozzarella cheese this burger be so big i couldnt even bite it i have to take out the veggies and eat it as a side salad if youre look for a chill bar to grab a cold one crazy fun atmosphere for the ufc or feel nostalgic for some street fighter ii this be a great alternative to the big boy chain who know you may even be lucky enough to have heather as your bartender she be fantastic  come here for ufc 217 the website and poster say there would be drink specials with your pay cover charge for the event which turn out not to be true the only thing stop this place from get a 5 out of 5 our waitress be awesome and the pizza be great plenty of tvs and not too rowdy at all for an event we will definitely come back but hope in the future they mention that there arent the specials which be list for the event before pay  stop by to watch a ufc fight there be 2 bouncers at the door one politely inform me the place be full as i be reach for my phone to call my bf the other bouncer clearly drink say but youre hot if youre alone you can come in he move on quickly and start have a conversation with one of the servers about some customers they be rude and unprofessional if you need to vent and talk s about customers go to the kitchen or to a place where no one can hear you  great atmosphere great bar food super friendly service bartender be very attentive we usually come here after work late night early morning crowd already go front door be lock for safety must ring bell for entrance my favorite items from menu grill chicken and avocado sandwich with fry chicken be tender cheese be perfectly melt tomato slice red onions and avocado be greatly enhance the sandwich steak and egg with hash brown and a choice of toast the breakfast steak be 6 oz and it can be a hit or miss i never have any problems but last weekend my bf didnt like the steak at all it have a very sour taste i guess to vinegary i dont know anyway bartender immediately apologize for not like the meat and offer something else from the menu also take it off from the bill no arguments no ifs and no buts very easy transaction his attitude make the whole experience absolutely great its all about service we be definitely keep come back here  since this be the pub for seattle seahawk fan decide to stop in and catch the preseason game against the vikings arrive about 6 30 and have no trouble find a seat order a beer and my girlfriend order a margarita for dinner we order burgers my girlfriend order hers well do it arrive nearly raw in the middle we send it back and she get one that be cook properly the second time other than that the food be great and really good service have a fun time cheer on the seahawks  the group i be with have a great time at this local pub last night 7 24 16 once you enter the pub you will notice the main din room and to the leave be the entry way to the bar that be spacious and make to accomadate large group the third room that be adjacent to the bar be a game room with bar stool and table plus a pool table shuffleboard various arcade game along the wall the food be great and the service be on point give that they have a few servers at the time since it be a sunday some of the items that we have that be notable be the chicken finger they come in two large piece that look like fish fillet but the bread be light and crispy with a good amount of chicken with curly fry but you have the option of get plain fry or tater tot other items that our group enjoy be the southwest eggrolls and the homemade chip and fresh salsa that come with 3 sauce mild spicy guacamole portion size be great for share especially the small size chicken nachos that my friend order be delicious great place to catch a game since they approximately have about 22 flat screen throughout the bar game room and main din room since the din room be seperated from the bar with large windows its good to bring families that want to catch a game together will be back if im in the area or to hangout with friends  i have be go here since they open and i suggest to one of the owners he need to get buzz time trivia and he listen i love it that they still have the trivia i know a lot of people who will go to a place just because of trivia anyway havent be here in a while and i notice they take off their ahi tuna salad entree and appetizer noooooo those items be the best things on the menu arrrgggghhh settle for the pretzel bite i love nacho sauce and warm pretzels they be very good my friend and i split the nachos order vegetarian and they be huge delicious too this place be pretty big with shuffleboard and dart in a big man cave room huge projector tv it be very invite and good for big group a  stop by to watch a game i didnt gamble but do eat pretty solid menu and big cold beer i be happy staff be friendly lot of tvs to watch the llws  smokey water taste ehh local joint its not horrible but when youd rather drink the beer than the water then theres a bite something that need to be do with filter as with everywhere if the ventilation isnt good the place just pile up with smoke and for someone that doesnt like smoke its not fun time no fun time we stop by because a colleague of mine be in town stay at the holiday inn that be right there next to scooters and so we want to find a place we could talk drink and not have to drive too far this place suffice but i have to say that there be a lot of local joint and this be just an okay place unfortunately not my first pick of taverns or pubs  1st time go to scooters yesterday after wait almost 5 minutes to order a drink i have to ask 3 time after give the bartender my order for a drink to please get it for me she keep forget finally the food server get it for me the service be extremely slow food be fair be really bum because i be expect more after read the review by others before me will not be return on to greener pasture  a group of yelpers come here after an event at shine i be not expect this place to be anything different than any other bar for the most part they serve the same kind of food as the rest but how much i enjoy it surprise me carolyn m have order the french dip with curly fry and i keep sneak a few bite here and there the fry be crispy and not drench in oil win the sandwich be also delicious the meat be tender the bread have a garlic bread flavor to it and soak up all the au jus they also have fry oreos here go downtown for this treat be for the experience come to scooters be for quality each order come with six of these fatty morsels and ice cream i eat half of one and stop it be ungodly the cookie inside soften but still retain a chewiness it be so good i might drink green smoothies practice yoga and exercise five time a week and eat healthy 75 of the time but i do it to let myself indulge in these type of days i might make fun of my friend for her work out to fee her horrible eat habit but i be really no better my body be a temple it clearly love me for give it deep fry anything and hat me for put it through hell to make up for it  i visit this establishment look for a place to sit with friends and enjoy a couple of drink i think this bar have great drink price especially during happy hour or when football be play i have a 20 onz miller lite for 3 even though there be a lot of game play the place wasnt too noisy i actually be able to talk with my friends and enjoy the game the only thing that deter me from come back be that the bar be very smokey there be not a lot of people smoke yet the whole place smell like smoke most of the time it just felt like there be someone smoke right next to me when in reality the closest smoker be nowhere close overall great price do not try the food but it do look good  7 28 17 always enjoy come here food be great awesome happy hour specials staff be very friendly best part its a seahawks bar be here many time and will continue to come here for seahawks game  this be the new home for the las vegas seahawkers so i will probably spend a lot of time here in the future they have a ton of beer to choose from and the price be decent also the food be fairly decent i have the cajun burger with curly fry and it be very juicy and solid the fry be good too probably the cleanest dive bar i have ever be my only complaint be that even though they have a lot of tvs they be fairly small except for the projection tv that be not very clear however this be defiantlyan upgrade from the previous seahawks bar torinos that be probably as bad as it could be  weve have a restaurant com certificate for scooters for a long time but since its not near us we wait until we be within strike distance as it turn out we didnt use it we enter a big room that be completely empty no gamblers no diners we didnt think it be go to bode well but the very friendly waiter bartender say that in his four years there he have never see anything like it we believe him there be a lot to choose from on the menu i order the sirloin sandwich with a side of slaw and my husband choose the chicken blta salad which have grill chicken with bacon tomatoes avocado and shred cheese it be huge and he have half of it for lunch the next day i think the chicken on his salad look dry but when i taste it it be surprisingly moist and not oversalted my steak sandwich be another story the steak be tough gristly and taste as if it have be marinate in a salt bath it be inedible the waiter offer to bring me something else but i wasnt very hungry to start with so i fill up on the cole slaw and nurse my apple orchard cider the cole slaw be very different it be creamy without be mayonnaise y and i deduce that it be make with greek yogurt but after congratulate myself on order a healthier alternative to fry the waiter put me in my place when he tell me it be make with bleu cheese dress so much for healthy since my steak sandwich be a fiasco i be go to give scooters three star i like the place despite the woeful sandwich experience the waiter deduct it from the bill so of course we werent go to use the certificate but because the service be so excellent and hubbys salad be so terrific ive bump it up to four  niners and their fan like to say whos get it better than us nobody but clearly heres one more thing seahawks and their fan have better than them besides a super bowl win in this century haha seriously this bar serve way better food and have a way better environment than the niners bar down the road order the pastrami burger you wont regret it its a burger with pastrami pile on top in a bun its not small sorry i didnt take a good pic so didnt it be delicious on a its own but i dump some of your typical condiments a1 ketchup hot sauce on it which also double as what i dip my curly fry in im sure if there be an option to throw an egg on it id do it next time this be already do but now will they throw on some bacon haha i dont like to usually change things especially when theyre already good but why not the curly fry come season they have a decent happy hour that go monday friday 3pm 7pm and 12am 3am 5 on various apps like wing finger a mini nacho ive have the potato skin and mozzarella stick 50 off domestic draft they have a separate din area from the bar area but really why would you not sit at the bar i didnt notice a smoke smell the bar be decorate in a lot of sport memorabilia include a joe montana niners jersey they have various bar activities like dart billiards and shuffle board a number of tvs and from what i hear free show of ufc events which it get pack for their beer selection be ok not a lot of craft beers but the service the pastrami burger and the environment be all they need to make me a fan niners fan dont fill bad cause i think theres a bar in henderson that have a very nice selection of craft beers  saw their coupon in lv weekly for march madness which advertise 4 nachos 2 for 2 sliders and 1 hot dog along with 20 match play so what better place to sweat my ncaa bracket which all fell to piece this past weekend but thats what i get for watch less than an hour of cbball the entire year my wife get deal a 9 high straight flush on a 3 play machine the first time we go which take care of the food and then some i end up break even but still get 20 profit because of the match play that just go to overtipping the super friendly staff anyways the food be definitely better than the average bar with the sliders be some of the best ive ever have how be they that juicy my wife love the chicken finger here since they bread and fry them to order she joke that the finger be so big they should just start call them chicken hand unfortunately they get rid of the 20 match play our next time there since a ton of people be abuse the hell out of it figure as much so basically they would only give players another 20 if they lose the first 20 no big deal  i come here to watch the ufc on pay per view and love the way the bar be set up for it you have a bunch of high boy table and chair in one room and the bar in the other the room with the table chair start fill up about 3 hours before the main event i like to get there early to make sure i get a good spot i also dont pay a cover by come that early though i more than make up for the money on my bar tab waitress be friendly and attentive though they get really busy by the main event and the entire bar area be full of patrons friends of mine who be big seahawks fan come here whenever theyre in town to watch the game i hear its a riot and the bar be fill with seahawk fan food be good but standard bar food nothing extraordinary the portion be quite big  absolutely one of the best burgers in the whole city come monday through friday between 11 a m and 2 p m for the amaze lunch specials its a little smokey because its a bar but that staff be always very very nice and customer friendly i also like come here to watch the ufc fight the place be one various award for its bar food which be all amaze  its tough to let go of the good food and the good people who be here one thing i can say for sure be im go to keep come in until we get out right thank rich for go the extra mile on customer service and misty 1 and misti 2 your smile and welcome hearts keep bring me back  stop in with my boyfriend to check this place out and sit at the bar we be immediately greet by crystal who be just a super nice and outgo host she guide us through the menu get us our drink and chat for quite a while she appear to know most of the other customers and be very attentive i will absolutely be back in soon to visit with her again the nachos be my favorite food item that we try and the beer be nice and cold very refresh on a hot day the staff be by far the best part of our experience if you havent check out scooters youre miss out  typical chain type bar less than average food quality although it appear scratch make the taste resemble freeze pre make on the higher price range of the same freeze bar food you can get anywhere else 10 00 for potato skin really some items be scratch make but the quality leave a lot to be desire pizza crust have no flavor seem pre make mass produce burgers be average and not season no test of the entrees as i have no desire to go any farther host ufc fight yet they be never prepare for the crowd understaffed be an understatement take 10 15 minutes to get a drink food take close to 30 minutes on both occasion untrained staff operate sound system continuously turn sound off and turn music on only a 5 cover charge for ufc fight be the cheapest in vegas next to buffalo wild wing and that be about the only positive that stand out they let the place get way over capacity to where you can not walk through the place to get to the restrooms  dont let the name fool yaive visit this place a few time each time for a little something different and each time ive be pleasantly reward they have video game pool and shuffle board dart and drink even game machine for those feelin lucky ducky today i swing by to try the foodand let me tell you chicken caesar salad the way its intend on a cold plate cool lettuce evenly coat with dress top with hot chickens nicely dice from young to oldthis place have a little something for everyone include chill shots of j\\xc3\\xa4ger and patron if your local and need a spot this be the place for you ps anyone need a good cook our chef at scooters pub be a talented man his veggie pizza be outstanding  so i come here on a thursday night to check this place out after hear about it from a friend who work here this review be strictly for the bar area as we do not come here for food the drink be reasonably price as a pitcher of bud light be 9 and stoli be 5 so i cant complain they also have arcade game in the bar area which be kind of nostalgic especially see street fighter 2 and mortal kombat they have some great specials when the phillies be play but i didnt ask why the phillies maybe the owner be from philly i would have give scooters 4 star but we come here on karaoke night and the talent be mediocre at best see the reason i dont do karaoke be because i know i cant carry a tune and would prefer not to torture the other patrons in the place i guess after a few drink all logic go out the window and people will sing no matter how it sound anyways id probably come back on a non karaoke night  i be happy to see that scooters become the seahawks bar the location be convenient for me while the food be ok and the service be generally ok the whole experience be taint by one moment my brother in law be play the machine and in several hundred dollars after hit something not too big about 400 he cash out whenever he hit something about that size he cash out then start over eventually feed it all back in and then some one of the bartenders pay out the cash out and walk away he give the other bartender 20 and go back to play this be the third time that night that this have occur to my dismay the first bartender go to the other and ask how much he have tip he didnt indicate whether he think this be enough or not but either way that be not the point of course they be primarily work for tip but to ask this in front of us be rude and unacceptable this bartender may have think he be be discrete but it be loud enough for me to hear by the end of the night the bartenders be tip 140 but my brother in law be down 700 this may be the only seahawks bar in town but id rather watch at home than be insult like that  this tend to be a group happy hour spot with my coworkers so ive become pseudo regular not to the point where everybody know your name just yet but its become familiar just good ol sport bar fun the 2 bartenders i see when we go be both great good service and friendly the waitress on our happy hour day be awesome pretty good bar food cold beers in clean glass comps for game and a shuffle board table to top it all off any game you can play without have to put your drink down rank high in my book o fun  probably one the cleanest local bar i have ever be to meet up with some friends here the other night they have a ton of beers and you can join a beer club free and if you drink all the beers on there in like a 3 month period you get draft beers for free for the next 6 months or something like that it get you out of your comfort zone of normal beers bud light anyone and get you to try stuff you probably wouldnt food be better than normal bar i have the nachos good and there be a massive amount my husband have the pull pork sandwich with onion ring which he say be fine and our friends love the mac cheese the bartenders be great and very attentive i put in 20 into a machine which i usually dont do and of course all of my 3 beers be free they have tvs everywhere and pool table oh the bathroom be really clean i will definitely be head back  one of the bar that have ufc good drink but chicken wing could be more spicy than sweet  great place to catch a fight they pull down a large screen and have tvs all around the bar there isnt really a bad spot in the place i attend a ufc fight and they do charge a 10 cover most place charge cover though for the fight so it be ok the food be pretty good as well i have some nachos and a wedge salad i saw some people order burgers as well and they look really good the bartenders be all really nice and attentive as well the place be usually pretty quiet unless a big event be go on there be one pool table and 1 dart table chill place to hang out the knock on the star be because the people that hang out there be somewhat questionable i be watch my purse all night  first time i ever go to scooters pub be for a monday night football game it wasnt much of a game pittsburgh vs cincy but they have halftime and post game raffle and i end up win an authentic yes authentic not the cheap replica stuff bww give out jersey so that be pretty cool every time i go there the staff be always top notch and one of the bartenders even remember me after months of not be there there beer specials be usually really good and theyre food be really good i completely recommend have the sampler platter to try a little of everything but no matter what you do leave room for dessert because you must have the deep fry oreos they be unbelievable i love go to scooters and if youre a local hockey fan its a great place to watch wranglers away game check it out you wont be disappoint  sport bar what else can i say the bar area be huge with some game machine this place get crowd at time the bartenders be cool and the vibe be friendly i order the kobe dog footlong hot dog with all the trimmings it be really really good the chicken wing be also pretty good i browse through the menu and everything look so appetizing i like this place 4 star for food service and fun  i didnt sample the food but sometimes you go to a bar for one purpose to have a cold adult beverage with your bud and thats exactly what i do the environment be clean and open thank to super high ceilings and concrete floor the high ceilings help prevent the stale smoke smell you encounter at most pubs around vegas yes there be smoke but its not as thick as your average video poker hang we go in on a friday even and there be plenty of table for our large group plus there be electronic dart shuffle board and tvs to keep the restless ones entertain the beer be ice cold and the service be friendly and prompt i would definitely head back for some late night eat or to catch a game  decent look place on the inside but service be very slow nothing special nachos be okay they may want to consider have more than bartender on a friday night  come here because i be look for a hockey bar and some of the review say this be the place to go um no that wasnt the case i would have ask if she could turn one on but after she give me my first beer when i arrive i be pretty much ignore and the place be dead they have a lot of tvs show the same 2 college football game pretty standard otherwise no different than a pts or lodge couldnt say how the food be didnt stick around wont be back  i have family come into town and they want a lay back place where they could enjoy good food and a baseball game or two we jump on yelp and find scooters and think to give it a try we arrive just in time for happy hour the waitress we have be great she answer all our question and give input into what she think the best things to order on the menu be we receive our food promptly and enjoy a nice relax meal while watch some of our favorite team a downside to din here be they do allow smoke inside at the bar and as we all know there be no way of keep the smoke from travel throughout the restaurant overall great experience and i would recommend it to others look to just have fun and relax  a first visit to this casual bar and eatery yield mix result mozzarella stick be gooey spicy nachos be excellent along with very good potatoey potato skin spicy chicken noodle soup be very good with well cook noodles and carrots and a caesar salad with chicken and candy pecans include big chunk of brown chicken with mostly romaine leave cover by tasty bleu cheese vinaigrette dress garlic bread be creamy service be very good and portion be large but diane do not like her haddock fish chip at all 3 1 2 star overall  me and my buddy go here on a whim try to find some new place around the neighborhood and we be please with the service as well as the food although it be a sunday so it wasnt busy we be give more than enough attention by the staff who make sure we be happy with the food their burger be tasty as be there chicken avocado sandwich though they could both use considerably more avocado i order avocado for my burger i have a potato salad and my friend have curly fry nothing be special but everything be good we also have some wing which be drench in spicy garlic sauce a good thing we will definitely be try some more stuff here because its 24 hours and have a decent number of options to try  good eat ample tvs and projectors and nice beer selection unfortunately the liquor selection be small so if your look to party with cocktails id pass however be you love beer and sport this be definitely a bar to check out i have always have a great time at scooters and wont be shy of return  bartender be the sweetest she make awesome bloody marys too i come in for breakfast and be blow away the food be so good and its dirt cheap i have two pancakes two strip of bacon two piece of sausage two egg hash brown and biscuits with delicious gravy for 8 99 i will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu and hang with my new buddy  stop in to watch ufc 189 not a bad setup 5 entry for the fight and you should get there early if you want a seat separate din area to the bar so you can have your children with you if need be only order the nachos and they be edible but nothing super impressive but its nachos coffee wasnt terrible and the service be again on par its a sport pub that didnt have anything great that make me want to come back but its not terrible either so if your look for a place to gather and watch a sport event give it a look  this place be always outstanding fun friendly people come here all others stay away the staff be always fast friendly and prompt the burgers be all really tasty and the clam chowder look delicious the happy hour price be incredible and cheap great sport bar and they have shuffle board and pool table '),\n",
